# TODO Add code to get test coverage and update badger in README
# See second answer here for code to get coverage from unitttest: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29295965/python-coverage-badges-how-to-get-them
# See video here for how to create manual shileds.io badge: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNVRxb-MKGo&ab_channel=glebbahmutov
# - Note that will need specific script to set colour thresholds
# - For example: https://img.shields.io/badge/coverage-75%25-green url gives great looking badge
